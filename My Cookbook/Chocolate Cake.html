        <h2>This is the only chocolate cake recipe you'll ever need! It's SO moist and rich. Pair it with my Best Chocolate Frosting and it's a chocoholics dream!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cup (250g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅔ cup (56g) cocoa powder (I prefer this Dutch cocoa or this one) NOTE: if you prefer natural cocoa, my preferences are Ghirardelli 100% Cocoa and Hershey's Unsweetened 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup (110g) packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil (I prefer sunflower oil)</li>
            <li>¾ cup (180ml) full fat sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) pure vanilla </li>
            <li>extract 1 cup (240ml) hot coffee</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the base with rounds of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add both sugars and salt and whisk to blend well, pressing out any lumps of brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Combine eggs, oil, sour cream and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend well. Pour into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with an electric hand mixer on medium-low until blended. It will be thick and somewhat dry. Add the hot coffee gradually in two stages to minimize clumps forming and beat until evenly combined and the batter smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-33 minutes until cakes spring back when pressed gently and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes before inverting onto the rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the Chocolate Fudge Frosting.</li>
            <li>Assemble the cake. Once cakes are cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Use an offset spatula to spread about ¾ cup of frosting over the top, spreading it out to the edges. Place the other cake layer on top so it aligns with the sides of the bottom layer. Cover the entire cake with frosting and use the offset spatula to even out the sides and make swooshes and swirls on the top layer. Enjoy!</li>
