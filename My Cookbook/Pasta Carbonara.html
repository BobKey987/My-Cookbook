        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 slices bacon , cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>8 1/2 cups water , divided</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic , minced</li>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti or linguine</li>
            <li>1/4 cups finely grated parmesan cheese , plus more for serving (2 oz)</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tsp each salt and pepper , or to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley , for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Allow to simmer until water evaporates about 6 - 7 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until bacon is brown and crisp, about 6 - 8 minutes longer. </li>
            <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, until fragrant and lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs, egg yolk, parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now empty large bowl. </li>
            <li>Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired. </li>
            <li>Let pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2 - 4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional parmesan and parsley.</li>
        </ol>
